      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>
      
      <p>Happy Pappy LLC ("we," "our," "us") operates the Pappyship mobile application and related services (the "Service"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Service.</p>

      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>When you use Pappyship, we may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> such as your name, email address, and phone number when you sign up.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> details related to your membership with local businesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> basic information about your use of the Service (such as device type or log data).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not directly collect or store payment information. Payments are processed securely by third-party providers (such as app stores or payment processors).</p>

      <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and improve the Service.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you regarding your account and subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Ensure security, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.</p>

      <h3>3. Sharing of Information</h3>
      <p>We may share information only in the following limited ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> with trusted vendors who help us operate our Service (e.g., cloud storage, hosting).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> if required by law, regulation, or legal process.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not share your personal information with local businesses unless it is necessary to deliver the subscription or service you signed up for.</p>

      <h3>4. Data Storage & Security</h3>
      <p>Your data is stored securely on trusted third-party infrastructure. We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
      <p>Depending on your location (e.g., EU/EEA or California), you may have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of your information.</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
        <li>Request a copy of your information in a portable format.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can exercise these rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@pappyship.com">support@pappyship.com</a></p>

      <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>Our Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly.</p>

      <h3>7. International Users</h3>
      <p>If you access our Service from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed in countries where our servers are located. By using the Service, you consent to such transfers.</p>

      <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
